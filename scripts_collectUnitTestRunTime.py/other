"\nThis script is written to run Runit or Pyunit tests repeatedly for N times in order to\ncollect run time statistics especially for tests running with randomly generated datasets\nand parameter values.  You should invoke this script using the following commands:\n\npython collectUnitTestRunTime.py 10 'python run.py_path/run.py --wipe --test dir_to_test/test1,\nstring containing another test you want to run',...' True\n\nThe above command will run all the commands in the list 10 times and collect the run time printed out\nby the run.  Make sure there is no space between each command.  They are only\n separated by comma.\nIt will collect all the run time as a sequence, calculate the min/max/mean/std and store\nthe info as a json file with the testname in the directory where you are running this script.  Since the\nlast argument is True, it will add the current run result to the old ones run and stored already.  The\nstatistics calcluated will be over all the runs, old ones and new ones.  This is done to help you break up\nyour experiments into chunks instead of having to run it at one time.  If you are doing a fresh run, put False\nas the last argument\n"
