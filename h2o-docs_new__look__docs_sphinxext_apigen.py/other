"Attempt to generate templates for module reference with Sphinx\n\nXXX - we exclude extension modules\n\nTo include extension modules, first identify them as valid in the\n``_uri2path`` method, then handle them in the ``_parse_module`` script.\n\nWe get functions and classes by parsing the text of .py files.\nAlternatively we could import the modules for discovery, and we'd have\nto do that for extension modules.  This would involve changing the\n``_parse_module`` method to work via import and introspection, and\nmight involve changing ``discover_modules`` (which determines which\nfiles are modules, and therefore which module URIs will be passed to\n``_parse_module``).\n\nNOTE: this is a modified version of a script originally shipped with the\nPyMVPA project, which we've adapted for NIPY use.  PyMVPA is an MIT-licensed\nproject."
