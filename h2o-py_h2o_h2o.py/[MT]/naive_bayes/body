If the test dataset has missing values, then those predictors are omitted in the probability\n  calculation during prediction.\n\n  :param laplace: A positive number controlling Laplace smoothing. The default zero disables smoothing.\n  :param threshold: The minimum standard deviation to use for observations without enough data. Must be at least 1e-10.\n  :param eps: A threshold cutoff to deal with numeric instability, must be positive.\n  :param compute_metrics: A logical value indicating whether model metrics should be computed. Set to FALSE to reduce the runtime of the algorithm.\n  :param training_frame: Training Frame\n  :param validation_frame: Validation Frame\n  :param offset_column: Specify the offset column.\n  :param weights_column: Specify the weights column.\n  :param nfolds: (Optional) Number of folds for cross-validation. If nfolds >= 2, then validation must remain empty.\n  :param fold_column: (Optional) Column with cross-validation fold index assignment per observation\n  :param fold_assignment: Cross-validation fold assignment scheme, if fold_column is not specified Must be "AUTO", "Random" or "Modulo"\n  :param keep_cross_validation_predictions: Whether to keep the predictions of the cross-validation models\n  :return: Returns an H2OBinomialModel if the response has two categorical levels, H2OMultinomialModel otherwise.\n  '
