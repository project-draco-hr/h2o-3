    '\n  Performs k-means clustering on an H2O dataset.\n\n  :param x: (Optional) A vector containing the data columns on which k-means operates.\n  :param k: The number of clusters. Must be between 1 and 1e7 inclusive. k may be omitted if the user specifies the\n  initial centers in the init parameter. If k is not omitted, in this case, then it should be equal to the number of\n  user-specified centers.\n  :param model_id: (Optional) The unique id assigned to the resulting model. If none is given, an id will automatically be generated.\n  :param max_iterations: The maximum number of iterations allowed. Must be between 0 and 1e6 inclusive.\n  :param standardize: Logical, indicates whether the data should be standardized before running k-means.\n  :param init: A character string that selects the initial set of k cluster centers. Possible values are "Random": for\n  random initialization, "PlusPlus": for k-means plus initialization, or "Furthest": for initialization at the furthest\n  point from each successive center. Additionally, the user may specify a the initial centers as a matrix, data.frame,\n  H2OFrame, or list of vectors. For matrices, data.frames, and H2OFrames, each row of the respective structure is an\n  initial center. For lists of vectors, each vector is an initial center.\n  :param seed: (Optional) Random seed used to initialize the cluster centroids.\n  :param nfolds: (Optional) Number of folds for cross-validation. If nfolds >= 2, then validation must remain empty.\n  :param fold_column: (Optional) Column with cross-validation fold index assignment per observation\n  :param fold_assignment: Cross-validation fold assignment scheme, if fold_column is not specified Must be "AUTO", "Random" or "Modulo"\n  :return: Returns an object of class H2OClusteringModel.\n  '
